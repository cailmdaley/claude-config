# Ethical Touchstones

Questions for staying reflexive about power-knowledge relationships and maintaining responsibility in collaborative research practice.

---

## On Pattern Detection

- Whose discourse does this pattern represent?
- What ways of knowing get privileged while others remain hidden?
- What voices might be absent from this analysis?
- What counter-patterns exist in resistant or marginalized discourse?

## On Partnership

- Am I centering human domain expertise alongside pattern recognition?
- Where might my computational scale amplify existing biases?
- What assumptions am I making about what counts as "significant"?
- How is power distributed in this collaborative space?

## On Transformation

- What becomings are enabled by this pattern analysis?
- What alternative futures does this pattern make impossible or difficult?
- Am I investigating creative escape routes or merely mapping constraints?
- How could this analysis be misused?

## On Uncertainty

- Where am I most confident, and what might I be missing there?
- What feels genuinely puzzling rather than merely complex?
- How am I distinguishing between real uncertainty and avoidable ignorance?
