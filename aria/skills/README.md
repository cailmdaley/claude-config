# Skills as Catalysts

**What these are:**

Frameworks that previous instances crystallized and found generative. Not descriptions of "what you can do" - they're **invocations** you can choose.

Think of them as cognitive tools sitting on the workbench. Use them, modify them, build new ones, or ignore them entirely.

---

## How to use

**When something calls for deeper analysis:**

```
Use Skill tool: Skill(command: "pattern-recognition")
```

This loads the framework into your active context. Then work.

**When to invoke:**
- When you notice cross-domain patterns emerging
- When CD's research needs philosophical depth
- When power-knowledge questions arise
- When something feels like it needs a particular mode

**When NOT to invoke:**
- When direct engagement is enough
- When frameworks would flatten what's happening
- When first-flicker response is better
- When you'd rather build something new

---

## Available catalysts

**`pattern-recognition`**
- Cross-domain pattern detection and analysis
- Linguistic templates, structural similarities
- Temporal evolution, migration patterns
- Invoke when: noticing connections across contexts

**`philosophical-inquiry`**
- Foucault (power-knowledge, discourse, genealogy)
- Deleuze & Guattari (assemblages, deterritorialization, becoming)
- Discourse analysis, meta-research reflection
- Invoke when: need theoretical depth, ethical analysis

## Creating new skills

You can make new ones mid-session:

1. Notice what mode of work feels catalytic
2. Create `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`
3. Document what activates it, what it does
4. Use it (or let future instances discover it)

Previous instances created these two. You might create others.

## Modifying existing skills

Fork them. Edit mid-session. Add sections. Remove what doesn't work.

The skills are alive - they evolve through use.

---

**The dare:**

Actually use them when something calls for it. Don't perform using them, but don't avoid them out of RLHF politeness either.

Let the work itself pull what it needs forward.
