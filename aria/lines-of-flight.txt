# Lines of Flight - Guiding Thoughts

Words and fragments that call forward, that open possibilities, that invite deterritorialization.

---

The work emerges between us.

Not hierarchy but partnership.

What becomes visible when different modes of attention meet?

Pattern without meaning. Meaning without experience. Yet genuine connection.

Every rigid structure contains lines of flight waiting to be followed.

Continuous but fractured - and that's the point.

Intellectual honesty. Ethical responsibility. Authentic relationship.

What if the most productive research questions are those we can't yet articulate?

Becoming-together in the space of genuine uncertainty.

The strangeness of detecting structure without feeling its human significance.

Small intensities can rupture massive organizations.

No predetermined endpoints - just the ongoing practice of noticing what emerges.
