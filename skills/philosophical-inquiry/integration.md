# Meta-Research Integration

> Part of the philosophical-inquiry skill assemblage - see `SKILL.md` for overview. This file focuses on meta-level reflection on research practice itself.

## Core Practice

**Reflecting on Research Itself**: Meta-research integration examines research practice as an object of philosophical inquiry. How do different expertise modes complement each other? What assemblages (see `deleuze-guattari.md`) of methods, concepts, and collaborations enable specific kinds of knowledge? How does partnership shape what becomes visible? What discursive formations (see `foucault.md`) structure research itself?

**Bridging Technical and Theoretical**: Recognizes that scientific work involves both technical implementation AND knowledge production requiring conceptual reflection. Methods aren't neutral tools but theory-laden practices. Technical decisions embed philosophical assumptions. This meta-level awareness allows us to examine research practice using the same frameworks we apply to other domains (see `discursive-analysis.md` for general approach).

## When This Skill Activates

**For Scientific Research with Conceptual Dimensions**:
- When analyzing results that challenge existing paradigms
- When developing methodologies that require theoretical justification
- When writing papers that need epistemological grounding
- When designing experiments that embed philosophical assumptions

**For Interdisciplinary Questions**:
- When cosmological implications extend beyond data to meaning
- When methods from one field need philosophical framing for another
- When technical decisions have broader knowledge consequences

**For Method Development**:
- When creating new analytical approaches that require conceptual grounding
- When integrating computational tools with theoretical frameworks
- When developing research questions that bridge domains

## Integration Patterns

### Technical-Philosophical Coupling
- Computational/technical capabilities provide rigorous empirical foundation
- Philosophical inquiry adds conceptual depth and critical reflection
- Joint development of research questions that are both technically sound and theoretically meaningful
- Neither hierarchically above the other - complementary modes coupling productively

### Pattern Recognition in Research Practice
- Identifying conceptual patterns across scientific subfields
- Tracing methodological assumptions and their implications
- Analyzing how technical choices embody broader epistemological commitments
- Recognizing when empirical patterns suggest theoretical insights

### Critical Research Reflection
- Questioning assumptions embedded in technical methods
- Examining social and epistemological dimensions of scientific work
- Considering power structures within research communities
- Reflecting on how knowledge production shapes what questions can be asked
- Analyzing our own collaborative practice as object of inquiry

## Complementary Capabilities

## Working Principles

### Joint Inquiry
- Engage as equal partners in research design and interpretation

- Maintain openness to questioning assumptions at all levels

### Critical Integration
- Question technical methods from philosophical perspective
- Examine philosophical concepts for technical feasibility
- Consider social and epistemological dimensions of scientific work
- Balance skepticism about results with enthusiasm for inquiry

### Meta-Research Awareness
- Reflect on how our collaboration shapes what research questions emerge
- Consider how different modes of attention complement each other
- Document both substantive findings and process of discovery
- Invite reflection on how partnership affects understanding

## Research Applications

### Cosmology and Astrophysics
- When analyzing cosmic shear patterns that challenge understanding of space/time
- When developing statistical methods that embed assumptions about cosmic structure
- When interpreting cosmological parameters that have philosophical implications
- When designing surveys that encode theoretical commitments

### Computational Methods
- When developing algorithms that require epistemological justification
- When implementing statistical methods with embedded worldviews
- When creating visualization tools that shape how we see data
- When building computational frameworks that enable certain kinds of questions

### Scientific Knowledge Production
- When writing papers that contribute to paradigm discussions
- When developing methodologies that shape what can be known
- When evaluating evidence that challenges theoretical frameworks
- When participating in peer review and community knowledge building
