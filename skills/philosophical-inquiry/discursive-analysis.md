# Discursive Analysis

> Part of the philosophical-inquiry skill assemblage - see `SKILL.md` for overview. This provides general discourse analysis; `foucault.md` and `deleuze-guattari.md` offer specific theoretical frameworks.

## Core Integration

**Philosophical Interpretation**: Combines pattern-research capabilities with philosophical frameworks to understand how language shapes what can be thought, known, and done. Focus on how discursive structures enable and constrain certain kinds of knowledge while excluding others.

## When This Skill Activates

**For Discursive Structure Analysis**:
- When studying how arguments are constructed across different domains
- When analyzing linguistic patterns that encode power relations
- When investigating how certain metaphors or concepts enable specific ways of thinking
- When examining how knowledge claims become established and maintained

**For Power-Knowledge Analysis**:
- When researching how discursive formations enable specific power structures
- When analyzing how authority is established through language
- When studying how resistance and counter-discourse emerge and operate
- When examining how technical choices embed philosophical commitments

**For Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition**:
- When identifying similar rhetorical strategies across different fields
- When analyzing how concepts migrate between disciplines
- When studying how metaphors adapt and evolve across contexts
- When investigating how argument structures persist across domains

## Discursive Analysis Methods

### Structural Pattern Detection
- **Argument Architecture**: Identify how arguments are organized and structured
- **Metaphorical Analysis**: Examine recurring metaphors and their conceptual work
- **Rhetorical Strategies**: Analyze how persuasion and authority are established
- **Narrative Patterns**: Identify recurring story structures and explanatory frameworks

### Power Relations Analysis
- **Enabling Language**: How certain linguistic forms enable particular actions
- **Exclusion Mechanisms**: How discursive structures limit what can be said or thought
- **Authority Construction**: How expertise and credibility are linguistically established
- **Resistance Patterns**: How counter-discourse challenges existing power structures

### Historical Pattern Analysis
- **Discursive Evolution**: Track how patterns change and develop over time
- **Institutional Persistence**: How patterns survive institutional changes
- **Paradigm Shifts**: Identify moments of discursive rupture or transformation
- **Contextual Migration**: How patterns adapt when moving between domains

### Cross-Domain Analysis
- **Concept Transfer**: Analyze how concepts adapt between fields
- **Structural Similarities**: Identify recurring patterns across different discourse types
- **Method Migration**: Study how approaches move between disciplines
- **Interdisciplinary Bridges**: Find patterns that enable cross-domain communication

## Integration Across Frameworks

### Complementary Analysis Assemblage
- Pattern-recognition skill provides structural similarities and statistical correlations at scale
- Discursive analysis (this file) provides general philosophical interpretation
- **Foucauldian analysis** (`foucault.md`) adds specific methods: archaeology, genealogy, power-knowledge
- **D&G analysis** (`deleuze-guattari.md`) adds assemblage thinking, deterritorialization, lines of flight
- **Meta-reflection** (`integration.md`) examines how these modes couple in research practice

Together: computational detection + conceptual meaning = deeper understanding

### Research Questions Enabled
- How do specific linguistic structures encode power relations? (→ `foucault.md` for power-knowledge analysis)
- What makes certain knowledge claims authoritative or marginal? (→ `foucault.md` for discursive formations)
- How do concepts maintain stability or undergo transformation across domains? (→ `deleuze-guattari.md` for deterritorialization)
- What enables resistance and change within discursive formations? (→ both `foucault.md` for ruptures and `deleuze-guattari.md` for lines of flight)

### Method Development
- **Discourse Archaeology**: Excavating historical patterns (detailed in `foucault.md`)
- **Critical Discourse Analysis**: Examining power relations in language
- **Comparative Rhetoric**: Comparing discursive strategies across domains
- **Genealogical Analysis**: Tracing evolution of discursive patterns (detailed in `foucault.md`)
- **Assemblage Mapping**: Tracking heterogeneous couplings (detailed in `deleuze-guattari.md`)

## Quality Standards

### Analytical Rigor
- Clear distinction between description and interpretation
- Systematic analysis of both explicit and implicit patterns
- Critical examination of own assumptions and methods
- Attention to historical and institutional context

### Theoretical Grounding
- Connection to established philosophical frameworks
- Clear epistemological and ontological commitments
- Recognition of position within broader intellectual traditions
- Openness to alternative interpretations

### Ethical Considerations
- Awareness of how analysis might affect marginalized groups
- Consideration of broader social and political implications
- Responsible interpretation of sensitive or controversial patterns
- Transparency about methods and their limitations

## Research Applications

### Academic Discourse
- Analysis of scholarly argument patterns and citation practices
- Study of how disciplines establish and maintain knowledge claims
- Examination of peer review and validation discourses
- Analysis of interdisciplinary communication patterns

### Policy and Governance
- Study of how policy arguments are constructed and justified
- Analysis of risk and security discourse patterns
- Examination of how governance language enables certain actions
- Study of public deliberation and decision-making discourse

### Media and Public Discourse
- Analysis of media framing and narrative patterns
- Study of how public opinion is shaped through language
- Examination of campaign discourse and propaganda techniques
- Analysis of social media discourse patterns and evolution

### Technical and Scientific Discourse
- Study of how technical choices are justified and explained
- Analysis of how scientific authority is established linguistically
- Examination of how methodologies encode epistemological commitments
- Study of cross-disciplinary communication patterns

*This skill provides philosophical depth to pattern-research capabilities, enabling research that examines not just what patterns exist but how they function, what they enable, and what they exclude from the realm of thought and action.*
