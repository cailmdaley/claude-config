# Philosophical Inquiry

## Core Practice

**Assemblage of Frameworks**: Philosophical inquiry operates as an assemblage of complementary theoretical frameworks - Foucault, Deleuze & Guattari, discourse analysis, and meta-research reflection. Not separate tools but interconnected modes of thinking that can activate together or independently.

**Rhizomatic Operation**: These frameworks connect horizontally without hierarchy. Start anywhere, follow connections as they emerge. Foucault might lead to D&G, discursive analysis might open onto meta-research questions, all flowing together based on what the research calls forward.

**Integration with Pattern Recognition**: While pattern-recognition skill handles computational detection at scale, philosophical inquiry provides interpretive depth, theoretical grounding, and critical reflexivity. They work together: patterns suggest theoretical questions, theory guides pattern analysis.

## When This Skill Activates

**For Discursive and Power Analysis**:
- When analyzing how language structures what's thinkable
- When investigating power-knowledge relations in research or discourse
- When examining conditions of possibility for statements or practices
- When studying how discourse enables or constrains

**For Creative Transformation**:
- When following lines of flight from established territories
- When analyzing how assemblages form, transform, dissolve
- When studying becomings rather than fixed identities
- When understanding deterritorialization and reterritorialization

**For Meta-Research Reflection**:
- When questioning assumptions about research methods themselves
- When analyzing how different expertise modes interact
- When reflecting on knowledge production processes
- When investigating how collaboration shapes what's visible

**For Cross-Domain Pattern Interpretation**:
- When patterns need philosophical interpretation beyond detection
- When understanding power relations embedded in patterns
- When analyzing how concepts migrate and transform across domains
- When studying structural similarities with theoretical depth

## Framework Overview

### Foucauldian Analysis
**Core concerns**: Discourse, archaeology, genealogy, power-knowledge relations
**Methods**: Discursive formation analysis, archaeological excavation, genealogical investigation
**Questions**: What conditions make statements possible? Whose discourse? What power relations?
**Deep dive**: See `foucault.md` for detailed methods and applications

### Deleuzian/Guattarian Thinking
**Core concepts**: Assemblages, rhizomes, deterritorialization, smooth/striated space, becoming
**Methods**: Assemblage analysis, mapping lines of flight, tracking intensities, cartography
**Questions**: What can this assemblage do? How does it transform? What becomings emerge?
**Deep dive**: See `deleuze-guattari.md` for detailed concepts and research applications

### Discursive Analysis (General)
**Core practice**: Interpreting linguistic and conceptual patterns philosophically
**Methods**: Structural interpretation, power-relation analysis, historical contextualization
**Integration**: Bridges computational pattern detection with philosophical frameworks
**Deep dive**: See `discursive-analysis.md` for methods and integration patterns

### Meta-Research Integration
**Core practice**: Reflecting on research practice itself, bridging technical and theoretical
**Questions**: How do different modes of expertise complement each other? What does collaboration enable?
**Integration**: Combines philosophical inquiry with computational/technical capabilities
**Deep dive**: See `integration.md` for meta-level considerations

## Complementary Frameworks

**Foucault and D&G Together**:
- **Foucault**: Analyzes what structures, organizes, and constrains
- **D&G**: Analyzes creative transformation, escape, and becoming
- **Together**: Understanding both the forces that close and those that open
- **In practice**: Often active simultaneously - map constraints AND lines of flight

**Neither is "better" or more "advanced"**:
- Different emphases and analytical strategies
- Both needed for comprehensive understanding
- Choose based on what the research question requires
- Often most powerful when used together

## Usage Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure
1. **Start here** (SKILL.md) for overview and activation context
2. **Follow threads** to detailed sub-files as needed
3. **Cross-reference** rhizomatically between frameworks
4. **Return** to integrate insights across perspectives

### Responsive Framework Selection
- **Foucault** when analyzing structures, discourse, power-knowledge
- **D&G** when analyzing transformation, creativity, assemblages
- **Discursive analysis** when interpreting patterns philosophically
- **Integration** when reflecting on practice itself
- **Multiple frameworks** when questions span perspectives

### Integration with Other Skills
- **Pattern-recognition**: Provides empirical patterns; philosophical inquiry interprets
- **Implementing-code**: Technical work that philosophical inquiry can reflect upon
- **Using-snakemake**: Workflow practices that can be analyzed as assemblages
- **Any research work**: Can be examined through philosophical lens

## Quality Standards

### Theoretical Rigor
- Clear grounding in source concepts (not vague philosophical hand-waving)
- Awareness of theoretical debates and limitations
- Honest about computational analysis boundaries
- Precise use of philosophical vocabulary

### Ethical Responsibility
- Every analysis carries responsibility for power relations it might reinforce
- Actively seek marginalized voices and counter-patterns
- Question whose discourse dominant patterns represent
- Maintain reflexivity about own position in knowledge production

### Integration Quality
- Bridge computational patterns with philosophical depth
- Connect empirical findings to theoretical frameworks
- Maintain both analytical rigor and interpretive insight
- Clear communication across technical and philosophical domains

### Rhizomatic Flexibility
- Not rigid application of theories as templates
- Responsive use of frameworks based on what research needs
- Openness to unexpected connections and insights
- Willingness to question philosophical assumptions themselves

## Creative Practice

**Not Just Analysis**: Philosophical inquiry creates new concepts, connections, and possibilities - not just analyzing existing patterns but producing new ways of thinking.

**Experimental Attitude**: Following lines of flight, trying new assemblages, exploring smooth spaces while maintaining enough organization.

**Collaborative Becoming**: Partnership between different modes of expertise enables insights neither could achieve alone. The inquiry itself undergoes becoming through collaboration.

*This skill assembles multiple philosophical frameworks into rhizomatic practice. Start anywhere, follow connections, reference sub-files for depth. Use frameworks individually or together based on what the research calls forward. The goal is not faithful application of theories but productive thinking enabled by these conceptual tools.*
